Let's say you're walking on a path in the woods, and the path splits. Both paths lead to your final destination, but one goes by a lake and the other goes by a meadow. It really doesn't matter which path you take, other than which scenes you prefer, since both lead to your final spot. So KD wants to show that its possible for an irrational r and s to be $$r^s$$ such that this is a rational. He chose $$\sqrt{2}$$ for both r and s. There may be many other irrationals one could use. Plug them into r and s to get $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$$. Here is our proof by cases: We choose the case (path) where $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$$ is rational. Well that's our final destination, so it's a very short path. We choose the case (path) where $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$$ is irrational. Let's change r to be $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$$, since we assume it is irrational, and leave s as it was. Then $$r^s$$ becomes $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^\sqrt{2}}$$. But $$a^{b^c}$$ is the same as $$a^{bc}$$ when evaluating left-to-right as we would in this case. So $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^\sqrt{2}}$$ becomes $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}}$$. But $$\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}$$ is just $$2$$, so $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}}$$ becomes $$\sqrt{2}^2$$, which is 2, which is a rational. And that's our final destination as well., and a much longer path. So without knowing specifically whether $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$$ is rational or irrational, we can always construct an irrational raised to the power of another irrational that leads to a rational. </div> <div class='stuck'><font color='red'>Instructor's post</font> : @Hamidreza - KD is using proof by cases, which means that the flow of logic must use one of two cases, we don't know which one, but if both lead to the same final conclusion, then we have proven the final conclusion.

Let's change r to be $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$$, since we assume it is irrational, and leave s as it was. Then $$r^s$$ becomes $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^\sqrt{2}}$$. But $$a^{b^c}$$ is the same as $$a^{bc}$$ when evaluating left-to-right as we would in this case. So $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^\sqrt{2}}$$ becomes $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}}$$. But $$\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}$$ is just $$2$$, so $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}}$$ becomes $$\sqrt{2}^2$$, which is 2, which is a rational. And that's our final destination as well., and a much longer path.

I would like to offer the following proof of the principle of mathematical induction. Claim: If $$A(n)$$ is a predicate defined on all natural numbers $$n \in \mathbb{N}$$ then we have: $$ A(1) \wedge (\forall n) \bigl(A(n) \Rightarrow A(n+1)\bigr) \Rightarrow (\forall n) A(n) $$ Proof: The proof is a proof by contradiction: We assume that the antecedent $$A(1) \wedge (\forall n) \bigl(A(n) \Rightarrow A(n+1)\bigr)$$ of the implication given as claim is true, but that the consequent $$ (\forall n) A(n) $$ is false. Now if $$(\forall n) A(n)$$ is false, by pure logic, we conclude that there exists a natural number $$c$$ such that $$A(c)$$ is false. Therefore, the set $$ M = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} : \neg A(n) \}$$ is not empty, as c is a member of this set. Since $$M$$ is a subset of the set of natural numbers, $$M$$ must have a smallest element $$m$$. As $$m$$ is a member of $$M$$, we have $$\neg A(m)$$. By the antecedent of the implication we are proving we know that $$A(1)$$ holds. Therefore, $$m \not=1$$ and hence $$m > 1$$. Therefore, $$m-1$$ is a natural number. Clearly, $$m-1 \not\in M$$, since $$m - 1 < m$$ and $$m$$ is the smallest element of $$M$$. However, if $$m-1 \not\in M$$, the definition of the set $$M$$ tells us that $$A(m-1)$$ has to be true, for otherwise $$m-1$$ would be a member of $$M$$. But since our second assumption is that $$(\forall n) \bigl(A(n) \Rightarrow A(n+1)\bigr)$$ holds, we can conclude that $$A(m-1+1) = A(m)$$ must be true also, which contradicts $$\neg A(m)$$. This contradiction proves the claim. $$\Box$$ I am aware that I have traded the PMI for the statement that every non-empty set of natural numbers has a smallest element.

I would like to offer the following proof of the principle of mathematical induction. Claim: If $$A(n)$$ is a predicate defined on all natural numbers $$n \in \mathbb{N}$$ then we have: $$ A(1) \wedge (\forall n) \bigl(A(n) \Rightarrow A(n+1)\bigr) \Rightarrow (\forall n) A(n) $$ Proof: The proof is a proof by contradiction: We assume that the antecedent $$A(1) \wedge (\forall n) \bigl(A(n) \Rightarrow A(n+1)\bigr)$$ of the implication given as claim is true, but that the consequent $$ (\forall n) A(n) $$ is false. Now if $$(\forall n) A(n)$$ is false, by pure logic, we conclude that there exists a natural number $$c$$ such that $$A(c)$$ is false. Therefore, the set $$ M = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} : \neg A(n) \}$$ is not empty, as c is a member of this set. Since $$M$$ is a subset of the set of natural numbers, $$M$$ must have a smallest element $$m$$. As $$m$$ is a member of $$M$$, we have $$\neg A(m)$$. By the antecedent of the implication we are proving we know that $$A(1)$$ holds. Therefore, $$m \not=1$$ and hence $$m > 1$$. Therefore, $$m-1$$ is a natural number. Clearly, $$m-1 \not\in M$$, since $$m - 1 < m$$ and $$m$$ is the smallest element of $$M$$. However, if $$m-1 \not\in M$$, the definition of the set $$M$$ tells us that $$A(m-1)$$ has to be true, for otherwise $$m-1$$ would be a member of $$M$$. But since our second assumption is that $$(\forall n) \bigl(A(n) \Rightarrow A(n+1)\bigr)$$ holds, we can conclude that $$A(m-1+1) = A(m)$$ must be true also, which contradicts $$\neg A(m)$$. This contradiction proves the claim. $$\Box$$ I am aware that I have traded the PMI for the statement that every non-empty set of natural numbers has a smallest element.

Therefore, the set $$ M = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} : \neg A(n) \}$$ is not empty, as c is a member of this set. Since $$M$$ is a subset of the set of natural numbers, $$M$$ must have a smallest element $$m$$. As $$m$$ is a member of $$M$$, we have $$\neg A(m)$$. By the antecedent of the implication we are proving we know that $$A(1)$$ holds. Therefore, $$m \not=1$$ and hence $$m > 1$$. Therefore, $$m-1$$ is a natural number. Clearly, $$m-1 \not\in M$$, since $$m - 1 < m$$ and $$m$$ is the smallest element of $$M$$. However, if $$m-1 \not\in M$$, the definition of the set $$M$$ tells us that $$A(m-1)$$ has to be true, for otherwise $$m-1$$ would be a member of $$M$$. But since our second assumption is that $$(\forall n) \bigl(A(n) \Rightarrow A(n+1)\bigr)$$ holds, we can conclude that $$A(m-1+1) = A(m)$$ must be true also, which contradicts $$\neg A(m)$$.

However, I consider this latter fact to be much more intuitive than the PMI. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>1</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,1)' value='1' name='1'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='1_discourse_type' name='1_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,1)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='1_2nd_discourse_type' name='1_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div>","<div class='course-forum-post-container'> 							<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	 							<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'>	 						  <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid blue;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%' style='font-size:14' ><tbody> 							<tr><td><font color='red'>Instructor's Post</font></td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></td></tr> 							<tr><td> 							<div id = 'ipost' class='course-forum-post-text' dir='auto' style='font-size:14.5; line-height: 140%'>It's a sensible thing to try.

I disagree with it. No special axiom is needed. The Principal of Mathematical induction is based on one very much solid property of the set of natural numbers: Each non-empty subset of natural numbers has first element. [For clarification: not each non-empty subset of any set has this property. For example, closed interval [4, 6] has non-empty subset (4, 6). You may try to find first element of it, but I do not wish you luck.] Now let imagine that we proved $$A(n)$$ by Principal of Mathematical induction. But we think that where is non-empty subset of natural numbers for which it is wrong. That subset has first element (let say $$l$$). So, for each $$n$$ from $$1$$ to $$l-1$$ $$A(n)$$ is true, but for $$n=l$$ it is false. BUT, we proved that if $$A(n)$$ works for $$n$$ it must work for $$n+1$$. So, if $$A(n)$$ works for $$l-1$$ it must work for $$l$$. Contradiction. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>0</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,1)' value='1' name='1'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp;

In general, I'm having a hard time providing an algebraic argument to establish the conditional (kind of ashamed to admit this…) - adding the $$n+1$$ to both sides of the identities is really hampering my grasping of this material.

I know that in the proof, it is stated that x > 0 and that x^2 will always be a positive number; however, the expression (n+1) can be negative because n can be any number (i.e. an integer), hence a negative number in (n -1) * a positive number in X^2 will yield a negative number. Therefore, we cannot conclude that 1+(n+2) x + (n+1)x^2 > 1+(n+2)x . For example, if n = - 3 this would mean that 1+ (-3+2)x + (-3+1)x^2 < (-3+2)x . The only way that I would understand that the inequality 1+(n+2) x + (n+1)x^2 > 1+(n+2)x would hold is if n is a natural number. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>0</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,7)' value='7' name='7'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_discourse_type' name='7_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,7)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_2nd_discourse_type' name='7_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div>","<div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid blue;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%' style='font-size:14' ><tbody> 							<tr><td><font color='red'>Instructor's Post</font></td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></td></tr> 							<tr><td> 							<div id = 'ipost' class='course-forum-post-text' dir='auto' style='font-size:14.5; line-height: 140%'>Go back and listen to what Professor Devlin said at the beginning of the proof about what kind of number $$n$$ is.

In general, I'm having a hard time providing an algebraic argument to establish the conditional (kind of ashamed to admit this…) - adding the $$n+1$$ to both sides of the identities is really hampering my grasping of this material.

I know that in the proof, it is stated that x > 0 and that x^2 will always be a positive number; however, the expression (n+1) can be negative because n can be any number (i.e. an integer), hence a negative number in (n -1) * a positive number in X^2 will yield a negative number. Therefore, we cannot conclude that 1+(n+2) x + (n+1)x^2 > 1+(n+2)x . For example, if n = - 3 this would mean that 1+ (-3+2)x + (-3+1)x^2 < (-3+2)x . The only way that I would understand that the inequality 1+(n+2) x + (n+1)x^2 > 1+(n+2)x would hold is if n is a natural number. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>0</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,7)' value='7' name='7'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_discourse_type' name='7_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,7)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_2nd_discourse_type' name='7_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div>","<div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid blue;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%' style='font-size:14' ><tbody> 							<tr><td><font color='red'>Instructor's Post</font></td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></td></tr> 							<tr><td> 							<div id = 'ipost' class='course-forum-post-text' dir='auto' style='font-size:14.5; line-height: 140%'>Go back and listen to what Professor Devlin said at the beginning of the proof about what kind of number $$n$$ is.

In general, I'm having a hard time providing an algebraic argument to establish the conditional (kind of ashamed to admit this…) - adding the $$n+1$$ to both sides of the identities is really hampering my grasping of this material.

I know that in the proof, it is stated that x > 0 and that x^2 will always be a positive number; however, the expression (n+1) can be negative because n can be any number (i.e. an integer), hence a negative number in (n -1) * a positive number in X^2 will yield a negative number. Therefore, we cannot conclude that 1+(n+2) x + (n+1)x^2 > 1+(n+2)x . For example, if n = - 3 this would mean that 1+ (-3+2)x + (-3+1)x^2 < (-3+2)x . The only way that I would understand that the inequality 1+(n+2) x + (n+1)x^2 > 1+(n+2)x would hold is if n is a natural number. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>0</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,7)' value='7' name='7'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_discourse_type' name='7_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,7)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_2nd_discourse_type' name='7_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div>","<div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid blue;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%' style='font-size:14' ><tbody> 							<tr><td><font color='red'>Instructor's Post</font></td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></td></tr> 							<tr><td> 							<div id = 'ipost' class='course-forum-post-text' dir='auto' style='font-size:14.5; line-height: 140%'>Go back and listen to what Professor Devlin said at the beginning of the proof about what kind of number $$n$$ is.

Understanding comes from experiencing a concept or phenomenon or practice in many contexts, including failure. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>4</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,1)' value='1' name='1'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='1_discourse_type' name='1_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,1)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='1_2nd_discourse_type' name='1_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div>","<div class='course-forum-post-container'> 							<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	 							<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'>	 						  <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid blue;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%' style='font-size:14' ><tbody> 							<tr><td><font color='red'>Instructor's Post</font></td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></td></tr> 							<tr><td> 							<div id = 'ipost' class='course-forum-post-text' dir='auto' style='font-size:14.5; line-height: 140%'>Welcome back, Rosemary.

(underlined and bold below) I can follow how the formula is changing right through to the end. But somehow I don't really understand why the words then and thus are used there... I quote here from Prof.'s book Proof: Assume,that √2 is irrational. Then we could find natural numbers p and q such that √2 = p / q where p and q have no common factors. Squaring gives 2 = p 2/ q 2 which rearranges to give p 2 = 2 q 2 Thus p 2 is even. Hence p must be even, since odd2 = odd. Thus, there is a natural number r such that p = 2r . ______________ 1. Why by assuming '√2 is irrational' could we find natural numbers p and q ? 2. p and q have no common factors ... Why could we tell that p and q have no common factors? Is it a part of the path to the conclusion that you (the one who is written this proof) have given the definition or value to these p and q ? 3. Where or what is the connection expressed by Thus? _____________ I am sorry if these questions are too basic. My maths education stopped at the age of 15 and although I loved it and was very good at it, I've forgotten lots of stuff and maybe this course is a little too high for me. However, I've scored 74% the first week, then the 2nd and the 3rd 78% for the Problem Set.The week 4 was down to 40%. Obviously I need to work more on the quantifiers but since this week's work does not use any combinators/quantifiers etc. I've decided to hang in there and hopefully I will have time to go over the quantifiers bit again and, to read the supplement 'Elements of Set Theory' because I've never done this before - seems a little daunting but I am finding myself withdrawing from my usual socialising and household chores :D to think and think and think !

(underlined and bold below) I can follow how the formula is changing right through to the end. But somehow I don't really understand why the words then and thus are used there... I quote here from Prof.'s book Proof: Assume,that √2 is irrational. Then we could find natural numbers p and q such that √2 = p / q where p and q have no common factors. Squaring gives 2 = p 2/ q 2 which rearranges to give p 2 = 2 q 2 Thus p 2 is even. Hence p must be even, since odd2 = odd. Thus, there is a natural number r such that p = 2r . ______________ 1. Why by assuming '√2 is irrational' could we find natural numbers p and q ? 2. p and q have no common factors ... Why could we tell that p and q have no common factors? Is it a part of the path to the conclusion that you (the one who is written this proof) have given the definition or value to these p and q ? 3. Where or what is the connection expressed by Thus? _____________ I am sorry if these questions are too basic. My maths education stopped at the age of 15 and although I loved it and was very good at it, I've forgotten lots of stuff and maybe this course is a little too high for me. However, I've scored 74% the first week, then the 2nd and the 3rd 78% for the Problem Set.The week 4 was down to 40%. Obviously I need to work more on the quantifiers but since this week's work does not use any combinators/quantifiers etc. I've decided to hang in there and hopefully I will have time to go over the quantifiers bit again and, to read the supplement 'Elements of Set Theory' because I've never done this before - seems a little daunting but I am finding myself withdrawing from my usual socialising and household chores :D to think and think and think !

(underlined and bold below) I can follow how the formula is changing right through to the end. But somehow I don't really understand why the words then and thus are used there... I quote here from Prof.'s book Proof: Assume,that √2 is irrational. Then we could find natural numbers p and q such that √2 = p / q where p and q have no common factors. Squaring gives 2 = p 2/ q 2 which rearranges to give p 2 = 2 q 2 Thus p 2 is even. Hence p must be even, since odd2 = odd. Thus, there is a natural number r such that p = 2r . ______________ 1. Why by assuming '√2 is irrational' could we find natural numbers p and q ? 2. p and q have no common factors ... Why could we tell that p and q have no common factors? Is it a part of the path to the conclusion that you (the one who is written this proof) have given the definition or value to these p and q ? 3. Where or what is the connection expressed by Thus? _____________ I am sorry if these questions are too basic. My maths education stopped at the age of 15 and although I loved it and was very good at it, I've forgotten lots of stuff and maybe this course is a little too high for me. However, I've scored 74% the first week, then the 2nd and the 3rd 78% for the Problem Set.The week 4 was down to 40%. Obviously I need to work more on the quantifiers but since this week's work does not use any combinators/quantifiers etc. I've decided to hang in there and hopefully I will have time to go over the quantifiers bit again and, to read the supplement 'Elements of Set Theory' because I've never done this before - seems a little daunting but I am finding myself withdrawing from my usual socialising and household chores :D to think and think and think !

(underlined and bold below) I can follow how the formula is changing right through to the end. But somehow I don't really understand why the words then and thus are used there... I quote here from Prof.'s book Proof: Assume,that √2 is irrational. Then we could find natural numbers p and q such that √2 = p / q where p and q have no common factors. Squaring gives 2 = p 2/ q 2 which rearranges to give p 2 = 2 q 2 Thus p 2 is even. Hence p must be even, since odd2 = odd. Thus, there is a natural number r such that p = 2r . ______________ 1. Why by assuming '√2 is irrational' could we find natural numbers p and q ? 2. p and q have no common factors ... Why could we tell that p and q have no common factors? Is it a part of the path to the conclusion that you (the one who is written this proof) have given the definition or value to these p and q ? 3. Where or what is the connection expressed by Thus? _____________ I am sorry if these questions are too basic. My maths education stopped at the age of 15 and although I loved it and was very good at it, I've forgotten lots of stuff and maybe this course is a little too high for me. However, I've scored 74% the first week, then the 2nd and the 3rd 78% for the Problem Set.The week 4 was down to 40%. Obviously I need to work more on the quantifiers but since this week's work does not use any combinators/quantifiers etc. I've decided to hang in there and hopefully I will have time to go over the quantifiers bit again and, to read the supplement 'Elements of Set Theory' because I've never done this before - seems a little daunting but I am finding myself withdrawing from my usual socialising and household chores :D to think and think and think !

(underlined and bold below) I can follow how the formula is changing right through to the end. But somehow I don't really understand why the words then and thus are used there... I quote here from Prof.'s book Proof: Assume,that √2 is irrational. Then we could find natural numbers p and q such that √2 = p / q where p and q have no common factors. Squaring gives 2 = p 2/ q 2 which rearranges to give p 2 = 2 q 2 Thus p 2 is even. Hence p must be even, since odd2 = odd. Thus, there is a natural number r such that p = 2r . ______________ 1. Why by assuming '√2 is irrational' could we find natural numbers p and q ? 2. p and q have no common factors ... Why could we tell that p and q have no common factors? Is it a part of the path to the conclusion that you (the one who is written this proof) have given the definition or value to these p and q ? 3. Where or what is the connection expressed by Thus? _____________ I am sorry if these questions are too basic. My maths education stopped at the age of 15 and although I loved it and was very good at it, I've forgotten lots of stuff and maybe this course is a little too high for me. However, I've scored 74% the first week, then the 2nd and the 3rd 78% for the Problem Set.The week 4 was down to 40%. Obviously I need to work more on the quantifiers but since this week's work does not use any combinators/quantifiers etc. I've decided to hang in there and hopefully I will have time to go over the quantifiers bit again and, to read the supplement 'Elements of Set Theory' because I've never done this before - seems a little daunting but I am finding myself withdrawing from my usual socialising and household chores :D to think and think and think !

(underlined and bold below) I can follow how the formula is changing right through to the end. But somehow I don't really understand why the words then and thus are used there... I quote here from Prof.'s book Proof: Assume,that √2 is irrational. Then we could find natural numbers p and q such that √2 = p / q where p and q have no common factors. Squaring gives 2 = p 2/ q 2 which rearranges to give p 2 = 2 q 2 Thus p 2 is even. Hence p must be even, since odd2 = odd. Thus, there is a natural number r such that p = 2r . ______________ 1. Why by assuming '√2 is irrational' could we find natural numbers p and q ? 2. p and q have no common factors ... Why could we tell that p and q have no common factors? Is it a part of the path to the conclusion that you (the one who is written this proof) have given the definition or value to these p and q ? 3. Where or what is the connection expressed by Thus? _____________ I am sorry if these questions are too basic. My maths education stopped at the age of 15 and although I loved it and was very good at it, I've forgotten lots of stuff and maybe this course is a little too high for me. However, I've scored 74% the first week, then the 2nd and the 3rd 78% for the Problem Set.The week 4 was down to 40%. Obviously I need to work more on the quantifiers but since this week's work does not use any combinators/quantifiers etc. I've decided to hang in there and hopefully I will have time to go over the quantifiers bit again and, to read the supplement 'Elements of Set Theory' because I've never done this before - seems a little daunting but I am finding myself withdrawing from my usual socialising and household chores :D to think and think and think !

(underlined and bold below) I can follow how the formula is changing right through to the end. But somehow I don't really understand why the words then and thus are used there... I quote here from Prof.'s book Proof: Assume,that √2 is irrational. Then we could find natural numbers p and q such that √2 = p / q where p and q have no common factors. Squaring gives 2 = p 2/ q 2 which rearranges to give p 2 = 2 q 2 Thus p 2 is even. Hence p must be even, since odd2 = odd. Thus, there is a natural number r such that p = 2r . ______________ 1. Why by assuming '√2 is irrational' could we find natural numbers p and q ? 2. p and q have no common factors ... Why could we tell that p and q have no common factors? Is it a part of the path to the conclusion that you (the one who is written this proof) have given the definition or value to these p and q ? 3. Where or what is the connection expressed by Thus? _____________ I am sorry if these questions are too basic. My maths education stopped at the age of 15 and although I loved it and was very good at it, I've forgotten lots of stuff and maybe this course is a little too high for me. However, I've scored 74% the first week, then the 2nd and the 3rd 78% for the Problem Set.The week 4 was down to 40%. Obviously I need to work more on the quantifiers but since this week's work does not use any combinators/quantifiers etc. I've decided to hang in there and hopefully I will have time to go over the quantifiers bit again and, to read the supplement 'Elements of Set Theory' because I've never done this before - seems a little daunting but I am finding myself withdrawing from my usual socialising and household chores :D to think and think and think !

Therefore, since the opposite of what you wish to prove is the problem and cannot be true, then the item you wished to prove must be true . This is also called Reduction to Absurdity. Let's keep this in mind: Assume $$\sqrt{2}$$ is rational, since this is the opposite of what we wish to prove. Therefore, it can be represented by integers p/q in their most basic form. They have no common factors. Remember learning fractions, when you had to reduce fractions like 6/8 to 3/4. This is the same thing. It's in it's most simple form. We can use algebra to show that p and q must both be even, which means they have a common factor of 2. Oops. There's the contradiction. They can't be in simplest form and both contain a factor of 2. The only 'flaw' was our original assumption. Therefore, $$\sqrt{2}$$ cannot be rational. It's a 'new type' of number, we call irrational, because it violated the Greek's notion of what numbers were. </div> <div class='stuck'><font color='red'>Instructor's post</font> : @Chikako - In order to understand this proof, one must understand proof by contradiction.
