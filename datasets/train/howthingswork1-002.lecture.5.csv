The advantage of this would have been seen in 'falling balls part 2' where you were obliged to call the Newton an 'esoteric unit'.

I am enjoying the course and am particularly impressed with the demonstrations (position one glance, velocity two glances, acceleration three glances was brilliant and more profound than it first appeared). However, Ido not see the point in persevering with the pound-force? It never was a useful unit in mechanics and in physics terms has no future.

Nonetheless, I understand when others don't appreciate that habit of mine. The process (rather than negotiation) that occurs when you set a wagon on a sidewalk involves the same physics as the process that occurs when a person lands on a trampoline (or drops from a bungee cord, and so on). The person bounces up and down for a while until finally settling down at equilibrium (i.e., in a situation in which the person experiences zero net force and does not accelerate). Whenever the person is above that equilibrium, the person is under-supported by the trampoline, experiences a downward net force, and accelerates downward. That person will soon be heading downward and will coast through equilibrium. By 'coast through equilibrium' I mean that they will reach the equilibrium position (or height) and will suddenly be experiencing zero net force, but because they are moving downward, they will continue moving downward and overshoot the equilibrium. Similarly, whenever the person is below equilibrium, the person is over-supported by the trampoline, experiences an upward net force, and accelerates upward. That person will soon be heading upward and will coast through equilibrium. The person will bounce up and down about equilibrium until frictional effects waste their excess energy and all them to settle at equilibrium. By 'waste their excess energy', I mean that the seemingly endless bouncing will damp out as forces within the trampoline (and also the air) act to decelerate the bouncing person. Returning to the wagon on the sidewalk, the bouncing process occurs in a barely perceptible way, but it does occur. It must. And when the process is over, the wagon will be slightly denting the sidewalk -- just enough to cause the sidewalk to perfectly support the wagon. Hope this helps!

And when the process is over, the wagon will be slightly denting the sidewalk -- just enough to cause the sidewalk to perfectly support the wagon. Hope this helps!

Nonetheless, I understand when others don't appreciate that habit of mine. The process (rather than negotiation) that occurs when you set a wagon on a sidewalk involves the same physics as the process that occurs when a person lands on a trampoline (or drops from a bungee cord, and so on). The person bounces up and down for a while until finally settling down at equilibrium (i.e., in a situation in which the person experiences zero net force and does not accelerate). Whenever the person is above that equilibrium, the person is under-supported by the trampoline, experiences a downward net force, and accelerates downward. That person will soon be heading downward and will coast through equilibrium. By 'coast through equilibrium' I mean that they will reach the equilibrium position (or height) and will suddenly be experiencing zero net force, but because they are moving downward, they will continue moving downward and overshoot the equilibrium. Similarly, whenever the person is below equilibrium, the person is over-supported by the trampoline, experiences an upward net force, and accelerates upward. That person will soon be heading upward and will coast through equilibrium. The person will bounce up and down about equilibrium until frictional effects waste their excess energy and all them to settle at equilibrium.

By 'waste their excess energy', I mean that the seemingly endless bouncing will damp out as forces within the trampoline (and also the air) act to decelerate the bouncing person. Returning to the wagon on the sidewalk, the bouncing process occurs in a barely perceptible way, but it does occur. It must.

Nonetheless, I understand when others don't appreciate that habit of mine. The process (rather than negotiation) that occurs when you set a wagon on a sidewalk involves the same physics as the process that occurs when a person lands on a trampoline (or drops from a bungee cord, and so on). The person bounces up and down for a while until finally settling down at equilibrium (i.e., in a situation in which the person experiences zero net force and does not accelerate). Whenever the person is above that equilibrium, the person is under-supported by the trampoline, experiences a downward net force, and accelerates downward. That person will soon be heading downward and will coast through equilibrium. By 'coast through equilibrium' I mean that they will reach the equilibrium position (or height) and will suddenly be experiencing zero net force, but because they are moving downward, they will continue moving downward and overshoot the equilibrium. Similarly, whenever the person is below equilibrium, the person is over-supported by the trampoline, experiences an upward net force, and accelerates upward.

Your hand and the ball started out at zero speed and zero velocity; you applied a force (not necessarily constant) over some period of time, during which your hand and the ball moved some distance: the force and acceleration were not really instantaneous. Once the ball leaves your hand it retains the final constant velocity. The ball has no internal memory of the force profile/history that was applied to it. Also, the force and acceleration you apply may not be in a constant direction. Your arm may swing in an arc before releasing the ball. The ball's direction is determined by the release point. [Ignore putting spin on the ball.] If you were to do this experiment isolated in space, the ball would still be gravitationally attracted to your body (and vice versa). so the ball would be very, very slightly accelerated toward you, so its speed would be very, very nearly constant but very slightly decreasing. of course to throw the ball while in space involves other factors and complications that you can think about.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>2</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post's <b>clearly</b> refers to this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,6)' value='6' name='6'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='6_discourse_type' name='6_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,6)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='6_2nd_discourse_type' name='6_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #7 by User #1</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Wow!

Did the ball move? If so, can you estimate how long your hand was in contact with the ball? A tenth, hundredth, or thousandth of a second? There is the math/calculus sense of instantaneous but sometimes in physics there is also the sense of 'so fast that either I can't measure it or I don't care about the details during that interval'. Solving some idealized collision problems (whether elastic or inelastic), we may care about before the collision and after the collision but not during the collision, in which case we might model it as (effectively) instantaneous. If you've ever played pool, billiards or snooker and hit one ball into a second ball, you probably didn't care how long one ball was in physical contact with the other (and flexing)... you cared how to make the shot and the resulting trajectories and speeds. (though you might have perceived or at least not been surprised that the cushions at the periphery of the table flex during contact.)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>0</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post's <b>clearly</b> refers to this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,12)' value='12' name='12'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='12_discourse_type' name='12_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,12)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='12_2nd_discourse_type' name='12_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #13 by User #1</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Hi Walter, I agree with you man.

Like you say, in many day to day situations we don't even need to go into that much detail :).

Gravity complicates the story by exerting its own force on the ball. About the duration of the force and the idea of instantaneous pushes: we will see in Episode 6 - Bumper Cars that forces transfer a conserved quantity known as momentum. Again neglecting gravity, your push on the ball transfers momentum to it. Once you stop pushing, the ball carries that fixed momentum with it and can't change its velocity as a result. It has to keep moving steadily in order to have the constant momentum. The momentum you transfer to the ball is the product of your force times the duration of your push (if the force varies with time, we'd need to us calculus to deal with the time-varying force). Thus you can get the ball moving with a certain momentum (and consequently a certain velocity) with a large force exerted for a short time, or a small force exerted for a long time. In principle, you can also get it moving that way with an infinite force exerted from an infinitesimal duration, as long as the produce of that infinite force times the infinitesimal duration is equal to the usual value. This trade-off between force and duration involved in momentum transfers is a hugely useful idea. It explains, for example, why you'd rather land in an airbag during a car crash than in the steering wheel -- you transfer the same momentum to the surface you hit, but with the airbag that transfer involves a smaller force for a longer duration than would be present if you hit the hard steering wheel.

Once the ball leaves your hand it retains the final constant velocity. The ball has no internal memory of the force profile/history that was applied to it. Also, the force and acceleration you apply may not be in a constant direction. Your arm may swing in an arc before releasing the ball. The ball's direction is determined by the release point. [Ignore putting spin on the ball.] If you were to do this experiment isolated in space, the ball would still be gravitationally attracted to your body (and vice versa). so the ball would be very, very slightly accelerated toward you, so its speed would be very, very nearly constant but very slightly decreasing. of course to throw the ball while in space involves other factors and complications that you can think about.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>2</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post's <b>clearly</b> refers to this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,6)' value='6' name='6'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='6_discourse_type' name='6_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,6)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='6_2nd_discourse_type' name='6_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #7 by User #1</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Wow!

Did the ball move? If so, can you estimate how long your hand was in contact with the ball? A tenth, hundredth, or thousandth of a second? There is the math/calculus sense of instantaneous but sometimes in physics there is also the sense of 'so fast that either I can't measure it or I don't care about the details during that interval'. Solving some idealized collision problems (whether elastic or inelastic), we may care about before the collision and after the collision but not during the collision, in which case we might model it as (effectively) instantaneous. If you've ever played pool, billiards or snooker and hit one ball into a second ball, you probably didn't care how long one ball was in physical contact with the other (and flexing)... you cared how to make the shot and the resulting trajectories and speeds. (though you might have perceived or at least not been surprised that the cushions at the periphery of the table flex during contact.)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>0</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post's <b>clearly</b> refers to this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,12)' value='12' name='12'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='12_discourse_type' name='12_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,12)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='12_2nd_discourse_type' name='12_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #13 by User #1</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Hi Walter, I agree with you man.

Like you say, in many day to day situations we don't even need to go into that much detail :).

Gravity complicates the story by exerting its own force on the ball. About the duration of the force and the idea of instantaneous pushes: we will see in Episode 6 - Bumper Cars that forces transfer a conserved quantity known as momentum. Again neglecting gravity, your push on the ball transfers momentum to it. Once you stop pushing, the ball carries that fixed momentum with it and can't change its velocity as a result. It has to keep moving steadily in order to have the constant momentum. The momentum you transfer to the ball is the product of your force times the duration of your push (if the force varies with time, we'd need to us calculus to deal with the time-varying force). Thus you can get the ball moving with a certain momentum (and consequently a certain velocity) with a large force exerted for a short time, or a small force exerted for a long time. In principle, you can also get it moving that way with an infinite force exerted from an infinitesimal duration, as long as the produce of that infinite force times the infinitesimal duration is equal to the usual value. This trade-off between force and duration involved in momentum transfers is a hugely useful idea. It explains, for example, why you'd rather land in an airbag during a car crash than in the steering wheel -- you transfer the same momentum to the surface you hit, but with the airbag that transfer involves a smaller force for a longer duration than would be present if you hit the hard steering wheel.

Once the ball leaves your hand it retains the final constant velocity. The ball has no internal memory of the force profile/history that was applied to it. Also, the force and acceleration you apply may not be in a constant direction. Your arm may swing in an arc before releasing the ball. The ball's direction is determined by the release point. [Ignore putting spin on the ball.] If you were to do this experiment isolated in space, the ball would still be gravitationally attracted to your body (and vice versa). so the ball would be very, very slightly accelerated toward you, so its speed would be very, very nearly constant but very slightly decreasing. of course to throw the ball while in space involves other factors and complications that you can think about.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>2</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post's <b>clearly</b> refers to this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,6)' value='6' name='6'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='6_discourse_type' name='6_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,6)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='6_2nd_discourse_type' name='6_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #7 by User #1</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Wow!

Did the ball move? If so, can you estimate how long your hand was in contact with the ball? A tenth, hundredth, or thousandth of a second? There is the math/calculus sense of instantaneous but sometimes in physics there is also the sense of 'so fast that either I can't measure it or I don't care about the details during that interval'. Solving some idealized collision problems (whether elastic or inelastic), we may care about before the collision and after the collision but not during the collision, in which case we might model it as (effectively) instantaneous. If you've ever played pool, billiards or snooker and hit one ball into a second ball, you probably didn't care how long one ball was in physical contact with the other (and flexing)... you cared how to make the shot and the resulting trajectories and speeds. (though you might have perceived or at least not been surprised that the cushions at the periphery of the table flex during contact.)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>0</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post's <b>clearly</b> refers to this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,12)' value='12' name='12'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='12_discourse_type' name='12_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,12)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='12_2nd_discourse_type' name='12_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #13 by User #1</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Hi Walter, I agree with you man.

Like you say, in many day to day situations we don't even need to go into that much detail :).

Gravity complicates the story by exerting its own force on the ball. About the duration of the force and the idea of instantaneous pushes: we will see in Episode 6 - Bumper Cars that forces transfer a conserved quantity known as momentum. Again neglecting gravity, your push on the ball transfers momentum to it. Once you stop pushing, the ball carries that fixed momentum with it and can't change its velocity as a result. It has to keep moving steadily in order to have the constant momentum. The momentum you transfer to the ball is the product of your force times the duration of your push (if the force varies with time, we'd need to us calculus to deal with the time-varying force). Thus you can get the ball moving with a certain momentum (and consequently a certain velocity) with a large force exerted for a short time, or a small force exerted for a long time. In principle, you can also get it moving that way with an infinite force exerted from an infinitesimal duration, as long as the produce of that infinite force times the infinitesimal duration is equal to the usual value. This trade-off between force and duration involved in momentum transfers is a hugely useful idea. It explains, for example, why you'd rather land in an airbag during a car crash than in the steering wheel -- you transfer the same momentum to the surface you hit, but with the airbag that transfer involves a smaller force for a longer duration than would be present if you hit the hard steering wheel.

Once the ball leaves your hand it retains the final constant velocity. The ball has no internal memory of the force profile/history that was applied to it. Also, the force and acceleration you apply may not be in a constant direction. Your arm may swing in an arc before releasing the ball. The ball's direction is determined by the release point. [Ignore putting spin on the ball.] If you were to do this experiment isolated in space, the ball would still be gravitationally attracted to your body (and vice versa). so the ball would be very, very slightly accelerated toward you, so its speed would be very, very nearly constant but very slightly decreasing. of course to throw the ball while in space involves other factors and complications that you can think about.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>2</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post's <b>clearly</b> refers to this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,6)' value='6' name='6'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='6_discourse_type' name='6_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,6)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='6_2nd_discourse_type' name='6_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #7 by User #1</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Wow!

Did the ball move? If so, can you estimate how long your hand was in contact with the ball? A tenth, hundredth, or thousandth of a second? There is the math/calculus sense of instantaneous but sometimes in physics there is also the sense of 'so fast that either I can't measure it or I don't care about the details during that interval'. Solving some idealized collision problems (whether elastic or inelastic), we may care about before the collision and after the collision but not during the collision, in which case we might model it as (effectively) instantaneous. If you've ever played pool, billiards or snooker and hit one ball into a second ball, you probably didn't care how long one ball was in physical contact with the other (and flexing)... you cared how to make the shot and the resulting trajectories and speeds. (though you might have perceived or at least not been surprised that the cushions at the periphery of the table flex during contact.)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>0</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post's <b>clearly</b> refers to this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,12)' value='12' name='12'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='12_discourse_type' name='12_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,12)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='12_2nd_discourse_type' name='12_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #13 by User #1</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Hi Walter, I agree with you man.

Like you say, in many day to day situations we don't even need to go into that much detail :).

Gravity complicates the story by exerting its own force on the ball. About the duration of the force and the idea of instantaneous pushes: we will see in Episode 6 - Bumper Cars that forces transfer a conserved quantity known as momentum. Again neglecting gravity, your push on the ball transfers momentum to it. Once you stop pushing, the ball carries that fixed momentum with it and can't change its velocity as a result. It has to keep moving steadily in order to have the constant momentum. The momentum you transfer to the ball is the product of your force times the duration of your push (if the force varies with time, we'd need to us calculus to deal with the time-varying force). Thus you can get the ball moving with a certain momentum (and consequently a certain velocity) with a large force exerted for a short time, or a small force exerted for a long time. In principle, you can also get it moving that way with an infinite force exerted from an infinitesimal duration, as long as the produce of that infinite force times the infinitesimal duration is equal to the usual value. This trade-off between force and duration involved in momentum transfers is a hugely useful idea. It explains, for example, why you'd rather land in an airbag during a car crash than in the steering wheel -- you transfer the same momentum to the surface you hit, but with the airbag that transfer involves a smaller force for a longer duration than would be present if you hit the hard steering wheel.

Once the ball leaves your hand it retains the final constant velocity. The ball has no internal memory of the force profile/history that was applied to it. Also, the force and acceleration you apply may not be in a constant direction. Your arm may swing in an arc before releasing the ball. The ball's direction is determined by the release point. [Ignore putting spin on the ball.] If you were to do this experiment isolated in space, the ball would still be gravitationally attracted to your body (and vice versa). so the ball would be very, very slightly accelerated toward you, so its speed would be very, very nearly constant but very slightly decreasing. of course to throw the ball while in space involves other factors and complications that you can think about.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>2</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post's <b>clearly</b> refers to this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,6)' value='6' name='6'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='6_discourse_type' name='6_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,6)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='6_2nd_discourse_type' name='6_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #7 by User #1</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Wow!

Did the ball move? If so, can you estimate how long your hand was in contact with the ball? A tenth, hundredth, or thousandth of a second? There is the math/calculus sense of instantaneous but sometimes in physics there is also the sense of 'so fast that either I can't measure it or I don't care about the details during that interval'. Solving some idealized collision problems (whether elastic or inelastic), we may care about before the collision and after the collision but not during the collision, in which case we might model it as (effectively) instantaneous. If you've ever played pool, billiards or snooker and hit one ball into a second ball, you probably didn't care how long one ball was in physical contact with the other (and flexing)... you cared how to make the shot and the resulting trajectories and speeds. (though you might have perceived or at least not been surprised that the cushions at the periphery of the table flex during contact.)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>0</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post's <b>clearly</b> refers to this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,12)' value='12' name='12'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='12_discourse_type' name='12_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,12)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='12_2nd_discourse_type' name='12_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #13 by User #1</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Hi Walter, I agree with you man.

Gravity complicates the story by exerting its own force on the ball. About the duration of the force and the idea of instantaneous pushes: we will see in Episode 6 - Bumper Cars that forces transfer a conserved quantity known as momentum. Again neglecting gravity, your push on the ball transfers momentum to it. Once you stop pushing, the ball carries that fixed momentum with it and can't change its velocity as a result. It has to keep moving steadily in order to have the constant momentum. The momentum you transfer to the ball is the product of your force times the duration of your push (if the force varies with time, we'd need to us calculus to deal with the time-varying force). Thus you can get the ball moving with a certain momentum (and consequently a certain velocity) with a large force exerted for a short time, or a small force exerted for a long time. In principle, you can also get it moving that way with an infinite force exerted from an infinitesimal duration, as long as the produce of that infinite force times the infinitesimal duration is equal to the usual value. This trade-off between force and duration involved in momentum transfers is a hugely useful idea. It explains, for example, why you'd rather land in an airbag during a car crash than in the steering wheel -- you transfer the same momentum to the surface you hit, but with the airbag that transfer involves a smaller force for a longer duration than would be present if you hit the hard steering wheel.

Your hand and the ball started out at zero speed and zero velocity; you applied a force (not necessarily constant) over some period of time, during which your hand and the ball moved some distance: the force and acceleration were not really instantaneous. Once the ball leaves your hand it retains the final constant velocity. The ball has no internal memory of the force profile/history that was applied to it. Also, the force and acceleration you apply may not be in a constant direction. Your arm may swing in an arc before releasing the ball. The ball's direction is determined by the release point. [Ignore putting spin on the ball.] If you were to do this experiment isolated in space, the ball would still be gravitationally attracted to your body (and vice versa). so the ball would be very, very slightly accelerated toward you, so its speed would be very, very nearly constant but very slightly decreasing. of course to throw the ball while in space involves other factors and complications that you can think about.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>2</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post's <b>clearly</b> refers to this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,6)' value='6' name='6'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='6_discourse_type' name='6_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,6)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='6_2nd_discourse_type' name='6_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #7 by User #1</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Wow!

Did the ball move? If so, can you estimate how long your hand was in contact with the ball? A tenth, hundredth, or thousandth of a second? There is the math/calculus sense of instantaneous but sometimes in physics there is also the sense of 'so fast that either I can't measure it or I don't care about the details during that interval'. Solving some idealized collision problems (whether elastic or inelastic), we may care about before the collision and after the collision but not during the collision, in which case we might model it as (effectively) instantaneous. If you've ever played pool, billiards or snooker and hit one ball into a second ball, you probably didn't care how long one ball was in physical contact with the other (and flexing)... you cared how to make the shot and the resulting trajectories and speeds. (though you might have perceived or at least not been surprised that the cushions at the periphery of the table flex during contact.)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>0</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post's <b>clearly</b> refers to this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,12)' value='12' name='12'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='12_discourse_type' name='12_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,12)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='12_2nd_discourse_type' name='12_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #13 by User #1</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Hi Walter, I agree with you man.

Gravity complicates the story by exerting its own force on the ball. About the duration of the force and the idea of instantaneous pushes: we will see in Episode 6 - Bumper Cars that forces transfer a conserved quantity known as momentum. Again neglecting gravity, your push on the ball transfers momentum to it. Once you stop pushing, the ball carries that fixed momentum with it and can't change its velocity as a result. It has to keep moving steadily in order to have the constant momentum. The momentum you transfer to the ball is the product of your force times the duration of your push (if the force varies with time, we'd need to us calculus to deal with the time-varying force). Thus you can get the ball moving with a certain momentum (and consequently a certain velocity) with a large force exerted for a short time, or a small force exerted for a long time. In principle, you can also get it moving that way with an infinite force exerted from an infinitesimal duration, as long as the produce of that infinite force times the infinitesimal duration is equal to the usual value. This trade-off between force and duration involved in momentum transfers is a hugely useful idea. It explains, for example, why you'd rather land in an airbag during a car crash than in the steering wheel -- you transfer the same momentum to the surface you hit, but with the airbag that transfer involves a smaller force for a longer duration than would be present if you hit the hard steering wheel.

Once the ball leaves your hand it retains the final constant velocity. The ball has no internal memory of the force profile/history that was applied to it. Also, the force and acceleration you apply may not be in a constant direction. Your arm may swing in an arc before releasing the ball. The ball's direction is determined by the release point. [Ignore putting spin on the ball.] If you were to do this experiment isolated in space, the ball would still be gravitationally attracted to your body (and vice versa). so the ball would be very, very slightly accelerated toward you, so its speed would be very, very nearly constant but very slightly decreasing. of course to throw the ball while in space involves other factors and complications that you can think about.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>2</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post's <b>clearly</b> refers to this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,6)' value='6' name='6'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='6_discourse_type' name='6_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,6)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='6_2nd_discourse_type' name='6_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #7 by User #1</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Wow!

Did the ball move? If so, can you estimate how long your hand was in contact with the ball? A tenth, hundredth, or thousandth of a second? There is the math/calculus sense of instantaneous but sometimes in physics there is also the sense of 'so fast that either I can't measure it or I don't care about the details during that interval'. Solving some idealized collision problems (whether elastic or inelastic), we may care about before the collision and after the collision but not during the collision, in which case we might model it as (effectively) instantaneous. If you've ever played pool, billiards or snooker and hit one ball into a second ball, you probably didn't care how long one ball was in physical contact with the other (and flexing)... you cared how to make the shot and the resulting trajectories and speeds. (though you might have perceived or at least not been surprised that the cushions at the periphery of the table flex during contact.)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>0</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post's <b>clearly</b> refers to this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,12)' value='12' name='12'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='12_discourse_type' name='12_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,12)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='12_2nd_discourse_type' name='12_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #13 by User #1</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Hi Walter, I agree with you man.

Gravity complicates the story by exerting its own force on the ball. About the duration of the force and the idea of instantaneous pushes: we will see in Episode 6 - Bumper Cars that forces transfer a conserved quantity known as momentum. Again neglecting gravity, your push on the ball transfers momentum to it. Once you stop pushing, the ball carries that fixed momentum with it and can't change its velocity as a result. It has to keep moving steadily in order to have the constant momentum. The momentum you transfer to the ball is the product of your force times the duration of your push (if the force varies with time, we'd need to us calculus to deal with the time-varying force). Thus you can get the ball moving with a certain momentum (and consequently a certain velocity) with a large force exerted for a short time, or a small force exerted for a long time. In principle, you can also get it moving that way with an infinite force exerted from an infinitesimal duration, as long as the produce of that infinite force times the infinitesimal duration is equal to the usual value. This trade-off between force and duration involved in momentum transfers is a hugely useful idea. It explains, for example, why you'd rather land in an airbag during a car crash than in the steering wheel -- you transfer the same momentum to the surface you hit, but with the airbag that transfer involves a smaller force for a longer duration than would be present if you hit the hard steering wheel.

Yes. Friction has no role in determining whether an object has more inertia. Friction just opposes the relative motion between two surfaces in contact. As for the question -\xA0 does gravity play a part in holding heavier objects stationery and thus conveying more inertia? No. All matter that has mass, has inertia. Linking inertia and motionless is incorrect and dangerous. I have not view the video yet, so I do not know if the lecturer introduce Newton's first law. From Newton's first law, it tells us that\xA0 uniform motion (including motionless) is a 'natural state of motion' all objects would like to be in.

Yes. Friction has no role in determining whether an object has more inertia. Friction just opposes the relative motion between two surfaces in contact. As for the question -\xA0 does gravity play a part in holding heavier objects stationery and thus conveying more inertia? No. All matter that has mass, has inertia. Linking inertia and motionless is incorrect and dangerous. I have not view the video yet, so I do not know if the lecturer introduce Newton's first law. From Newton's first law, it tells us that\xA0 uniform motion (including motionless) is a 'natural state of motion' all objects would like to be in.

Yes. Friction has no role in determining whether an object has more inertia. Friction just opposes the relative motion between two surfaces in contact. As for the question -\xA0 does gravity play a part in holding heavier objects stationery and thus conveying more inertia? No. All matter that has mass, has inertia. Linking inertia and motionless is incorrect and dangerous. I have not view the video yet, so I do not know if the lecturer introduce Newton's first law. From Newton's first law, it tells us that\xA0 uniform motion (including motionless) is a 'natural state of motion' all objects would like to be in.

A heavy object is one with a large weight . An object with great inertia is one with a large mass . The two concepts involved -- weight and mass -- are different. Inertia is a characteristic of the object itself; weight is a force exerted on the object due to gravity. Nonetheless, those two quantities are related (something we'll see in Episode 2 -- Falling Balls). Here's how: It turns out that objects with great inertia (i.e., objects with large masses) are also quite heavy (i.e., objects with large weights) when there is gravity present. The remarkable thing is that gravity gives an object a weight that is exactly proportional to that object's mass (assuming everything is at the same location, because gravity can vary according to location). The profundity of that observation is hard to describe. Let me just say that it is the starting point from which Einstein developed his theory of general relativity.
