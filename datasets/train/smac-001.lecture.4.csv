Assume direct sampling. Newton: Each state is completely dependent on the previous state. In fact, all states are dependent on an initial state and all states are initial states for states that come after. For example, depending on velocity, some states are unreachable in small time. Direct sampling: All states are equally probable. Velocity is irrelvant and a given state is independent of previous states. In a sense, the two are opposites. Yet, they both lead to equiprobability, which is what is meant by equivalence. That is at anytime an observer looks, he will not be able to make any prediction about which state the system will be in before he looks. So, how to make sense of this? Here's what I came up with (after writing this it seems obvious). In the newtonian case it seems that an external observer might be precisely able to specify an initial state, and that observer will be able to track the state (because the observer knows newtons laws) externally so that when he looks a short time later, he'll be able make some prediction. The prediction will not be perfect because the precision of numbers is limited. The longer the system evolves without observation, the more the errors due to precision increase. The observer will be able to give a probability distribution as to where the particles might be. Eventually, that probability distribution will be come uniform, just as we have in the direct sampling case. So the equivalence. Other notes: kinetic energy must be greater than 0. Second, in the movie, the Newtonian case looks random, but if you take a snapshot of the state, you recover precise knowledge and can again predict future states to some degree. I assume this is not possible when you have millions, trillions of particles, in which case your observations consist of looking at values of macroscopic quantities such as pressure and temperature. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>1</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,1)' value='1' name='1'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='1_discourse_type' name='1_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,1)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='1_2nd_discourse_type' name='1_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 							<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	 							<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'>	 						  <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #2 by User #2</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							'Eventually, that probability distribution will be come uniform, just as we have in the direct sampling case.'

Assume direct sampling. Newton: Each state is completely dependent on the previous state. In fact, all states are dependent on an initial state and all states are initial states for states that come after. For example, depending on velocity, some states are unreachable in small time. Direct sampling: All states are equally probable. Velocity is irrelvant and a given state is independent of previous states. In a sense, the two are opposites. Yet, they both lead to equiprobability, which is what is meant by equivalence. That is at anytime an observer looks, he will not be able to make any prediction about which state the system will be in before he looks. So, how to make sense of this? Here's what I came up with (after writing this it seems obvious). In the newtonian case it seems that an external observer might be precisely able to specify an initial state, and that observer will be able to track the state (because the observer knows newtons laws) externally so that when he looks a short time later, he'll be able make some prediction. The prediction will not be perfect because the precision of numbers is limited. The longer the system evolves without observation, the more the errors due to precision increase. The observer will be able to give a probability distribution as to where the particles might be. Eventually, that probability distribution will be come uniform, just as we have in the direct sampling case. So the equivalence. Other notes: kinetic energy must be greater than 0. Second, in the movie, the Newtonian case looks random, but if you take a snapshot of the state, you recover precise knowledge and can again predict future states to some degree. I assume this is not possible when you have millions, trillions of particles, in which case your observations consist of looking at values of macroscopic quantities such as pressure and temperature. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>1</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,1)' value='1' name='1'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='1_discourse_type' name='1_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,1)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='1_2nd_discourse_type' name='1_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 							<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	 							<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'>	 						  <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #2 by User #2</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							'Eventually, that probability distribution will be come uniform, just as we have in the direct sampling case.'

Assume direct sampling. Newton: Each state is completely dependent on the previous state. In fact, all states are dependent on an initial state and all states are initial states for states that come after. For example, depending on velocity, some states are unreachable in small time. Direct sampling: All states are equally probable. Velocity is irrelvant and a given state is independent of previous states. In a sense, the two are opposites. Yet, they both lead to equiprobability, which is what is meant by equivalence. That is at anytime an observer looks, he will not be able to make any prediction about which state the system will be in before he looks. So, how to make sense of this? Here's what I came up with (after writing this it seems obvious). In the newtonian case it seems that an external observer might be precisely able to specify an initial state, and that observer will be able to track the state (because the observer knows newtons laws) externally so that when he looks a short time later, he'll be able make some prediction. The prediction will not be perfect because the precision of numbers is limited. The longer the system evolves without observation, the more the errors due to precision increase. The observer will be able to give a probability distribution as to where the particles might be. Eventually, that probability distribution will be come uniform, just as we have in the direct sampling case. So the equivalence. Other notes: kinetic energy must be greater than 0. Second, in the movie, the Newtonian case looks random, but if you take a snapshot of the state, you recover precise knowledge and can again predict future states to some degree. I assume this is not possible when you have millions, trillions of particles, in which case your observations consist of looking at values of macroscopic quantities such as pressure and temperature. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>1</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,1)' value='1' name='1'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='1_discourse_type' name='1_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,1)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='1_2nd_discourse_type' name='1_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 							<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	 							<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'>	 						  <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #2 by User #2</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							'Eventually, that probability distribution will be come uniform, just as we have in the direct sampling case.'

Assume direct sampling. Newton: Each state is completely dependent on the previous state. In fact, all states are dependent on an initial state and all states are initial states for states that come after. For example, depending on velocity, some states are unreachable in small time. Direct sampling: All states are equally probable. Velocity is irrelvant and a given state is independent of previous states. In a sense, the two are opposites. Yet, they both lead to equiprobability, which is what is meant by equivalence. That is at anytime an observer looks, he will not be able to make any prediction about which state the system will be in before he looks. So, how to make sense of this? Here's what I came up with (after writing this it seems obvious). In the newtonian case it seems that an external observer might be precisely able to specify an initial state, and that observer will be able to track the state (because the observer knows newtons laws) externally so that when he looks a short time later, he'll be able make some prediction. The prediction will not be perfect because the precision of numbers is limited. The longer the system evolves without observation, the more the errors due to precision increase. The observer will be able to give a probability distribution as to where the particles might be. Eventually, that probability distribution will be come uniform, just as we have in the direct sampling case. So the equivalence. Other notes: kinetic energy must be greater than 0. Second, in the movie, the Newtonian case looks random, but if you take a snapshot of the state, you recover precise knowledge and can again predict future states to some degree. I assume this is not possible when you have millions, trillions of particles, in which case your observations consist of looking at values of macroscopic quantities such as pressure and temperature. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>1</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,1)' value='1' name='1'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='1_discourse_type' name='1_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,1)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='1_2nd_discourse_type' name='1_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 							<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	 							<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'>	 						  <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #2 by User #2</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							'Eventually, that probability distribution will be come uniform, just as we have in the direct sampling case.'

In the code snippet provided (section A3.3.1), the positions are incrementally updated at all the intermediate times inter_times as you see in: for inter_times in range(int(t + 1), int(t + next_event + 1)): del_t = inter_times - t_previous for k, l in singles: pos[k][l] += vel[k][l] * del_t t_previous = inter_time ... This is necessary to collect data at integer times. After the for loop is completed, only a partial update of the positions is left to perform, since the rest of it has already been done step by step. Thus the line that in the original event_disks_box.py reads for k, l in singles: pos[k][l] += vel[k][l] * next_event has to be changed to for k, l in singles: pos[k][l] += vel[k][l] * (t - t_previous) This is because the position updates corresponding to part of the next_event time interval have already been performed inside the for loop. Also, make sure that this modified line comes after the line t += next_event and not before. I hope it is now clearer, we will add a warning in the assignment.

In the code snippet provided (section A3.3.1), the positions are incrementally updated at all the intermediate times inter_times as you see in: for inter_times in range(int(t + 1), int(t + next_event + 1)): del_t = inter_times - t_previous for k, l in singles: pos[k][l] += vel[k][l] * del_t t_previous = inter_time ... This is necessary to collect data at integer times. After the for loop is completed, only a partial update of the positions is left to perform, since the rest of it has already been done step by step. Thus the line that in the original event_disks_box.py reads for k, l in singles: pos[k][l] += vel[k][l] * next_event has to be changed to for k, l in singles: pos[k][l] += vel[k][l] * (t - t_previous) This is because the position updates corresponding to part of the next_event time interval have already been performed inside the for loop. Also, make sure that this modified line comes after the line t += next_event and not before. I hope it is now clearer, we will add a warning in the assignment.

In the code snippet provided (section A3.3.1), the positions are incrementally updated at all the intermediate times inter_times as you see in: for inter_times in range(int(t + 1), int(t + next_event + 1)): del_t = inter_times - t_previous for k, l in singles: pos[k][l] += vel[k][l] * del_t t_previous = inter_time ... This is necessary to collect data at integer times. After the for loop is completed, only a partial update of the positions is left to perform, since the rest of it has already been done step by step. Thus the line that in the original event_disks_box.py reads for k, l in singles: pos[k][l] += vel[k][l] * next_event has to be changed to for k, l in singles: pos[k][l] += vel[k][l] * (t - t_previous) This is because the position updates corresponding to part of the next_event time interval have already been performed inside the for loop. Also, make sure that this modified line comes after the line t += next_event and not before. I hope it is now clearer, we will add a warning in the assignment.

In the code snippet provided (section A3.3.1), the positions are incrementally updated at all the intermediate times inter_times as you see in: for inter_times in range(int(t + 1), int(t + next_event + 1)): del_t = inter_times - t_previous for k, l in singles: pos[k][l] += vel[k][l] * del_t t_previous = inter_time ... This is necessary to collect data at integer times. After the for loop is completed, only a partial update of the positions is left to perform, since the rest of it has already been done step by step. Thus the line that in the original event_disks_box.py reads for k, l in singles: pos[k][l] += vel[k][l] * next_event has to be changed to for k, l in singles: pos[k][l] += vel[k][l] * (t - t_previous) This is because the position updates corresponding to part of the next_event time interval have already been performed inside the for loop. Also, make sure that this modified line comes after the line t += next_event and not before. I hope it is now clearer, we will add a warning in the assignment.

Somehow the probability distribution was rewritten as the product of all [1 - indicator function]. Maybe I am just not that much accustomed to dealing with integrals, but I would think that if one of the indicator functions returns a 1 for an overlap I will have a '... * [ 0 ] * ...' somewhere. Should this not set the hole partition function to Zero? Of course it makes no sense that one impossible state destroys the hole partition function, so I would like to know where I misunderstand the syntax of the equation.

Somehow the probability distribution was rewritten as the product of all [1 - indicator function]. Maybe I am just not that much accustomed to dealing with integrals, but I would think that if one of the indicator functions returns a 1 for an overlap I will have a '... * [ 0 ] * ...' somewhere. Should this not set the hole partition function to Zero? Of course it makes no sense that one impossible state destroys the hole partition function, so I would like to know where I misunderstand the syntax of the equation.

Somehow the probability distribution was rewritten as the product of all [1 - indicator function]. Maybe I am just not that much accustomed to dealing with integrals, but I would think that if one of the indicator functions returns a 1 for an overlap I will have a '... * [ 0 ] * ...' somewhere. Should this not set the hole partition function to Zero? Of course it makes no sense that one impossible state destroys the hole partition function, so I would like to know where I misunderstand the syntax of the equation.

Somehow the probability distribution was rewritten as the product of all [1 - indicator function]. Maybe I am just not that much accustomed to dealing with integrals, but I would think that if one of the indicator functions returns a 1 for an overlap I will have a '... * [ 0 ] * ...' somewhere. Should this not set the hole partition function to Zero? Of course it makes no sense that one impossible state destroys the hole partition function, so I would like to know where I misunderstand the syntax of the equation.

Now, this is not just a matter of physics. Take the pebble and the heliport. If your throws are very short, it'll take a long time to sample the whole heliport (i.e. for the pebble to have visited all parts of it), and before you do, the estimate for pi will be very poor indeed. An analogy: Suppose you want to measure the area of a dish filled with water. What you have is oil and a way to measure the height of the oil film on top of the water. The idea is then to place a predetermined amount of oil on the surface of the water and once it has spread out measure its height, from which you can determine the area, right. Now the spreading out is a rather slow, diffusive process (incidentally, equations for the Markov Chain we used can be written in terms of the diffusion equation). If you were to measure the height of the oil film immediately, it would clearly depend on where exactly on the dish you do the measurement. Once you wait long enough, the entire dish is uniformly covered in oil, and it no onger matters where you do the measurement at. What is detailed balance in terms of this analogy? It means that there can be no net flow of oil from one place to the other, i.e. that the oil has been distributed evenly. In the beginning, the oil flows from oil-rich regions to places where there is not that much oil, but eventually a backflow will build up, and these two cancel out. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>1</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,5)' value='5' name='5'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='5_discourse_type' name='5_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,5)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='5_2nd_discourse_type' name='5_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div>","<div class='course-forum-post-container'> 							<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	 							<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'>	 						  <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid blue;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%' style='font-size:14' ><tbody> 							<tr><td><font color='red'>Instructor's Post</font></td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></td></tr> 							<tr><td> 							<div id = 'ipost' class='course-forum-post-text' dir='auto' style='font-size:14.5; line-height: 140%'>Thanks for the question.

Now, this is not just a matter of physics. Take the pebble and the heliport. If your throws are very short, it'll take a long time to sample the whole heliport (i.e. for the pebble to have visited all parts of it), and before you do, the estimate for pi will be very poor indeed. An analogy: Suppose you want to measure the area of a dish filled with water. What you have is oil and a way to measure the height of the oil film on top of the water. The idea is then to place a predetermined amount of oil on the surface of the water and once it has spread out measure its height, from which you can determine the area, right. Now the spreading out is a rather slow, diffusive process (incidentally, equations for the Markov Chain we used can be written in terms of the diffusion equation). If you were to measure the height of the oil film immediately, it would clearly depend on where exactly on the dish you do the measurement. Once you wait long enough, the entire dish is uniformly covered in oil, and it no onger matters where you do the measurement at. What is detailed balance in terms of this analogy? It means that there can be no net flow of oil from one place to the other, i.e. that the oil has been distributed evenly. In the beginning, the oil flows from oil-rich regions to places where there is not that much oil, but eventually a backflow will build up, and these two cancel out. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>1</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,5)' value='5' name='5'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='5_discourse_type' name='5_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,5)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='5_2nd_discourse_type' name='5_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div>","<div class='course-forum-post-container'> 							<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	 							<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'>	 						  <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid blue;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%' style='font-size:14' ><tbody> 							<tr><td><font color='red'>Instructor's Post</font></td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></td></tr> 							<tr><td> 							<div id = 'ipost' class='course-forum-post-text' dir='auto' style='font-size:14.5; line-height: 140%'>Thanks for the question.

Now, this is not just a matter of physics. Take the pebble and the heliport. If your throws are very short, it'll take a long time to sample the whole heliport (i.e. for the pebble to have visited all parts of it), and before you do, the estimate for pi will be very poor indeed. An analogy: Suppose you want to measure the area of a dish filled with water. What you have is oil and a way to measure the height of the oil film on top of the water. The idea is then to place a predetermined amount of oil on the surface of the water and once it has spread out measure its height, from which you can determine the area, right. Now the spreading out is a rather slow, diffusive process (incidentally, equations for the Markov Chain we used can be written in terms of the diffusion equation). If you were to measure the height of the oil film immediately, it would clearly depend on where exactly on the dish you do the measurement. Once you wait long enough, the entire dish is uniformly covered in oil, and it no onger matters where you do the measurement at. What is detailed balance in terms of this analogy? It means that there can be no net flow of oil from one place to the other, i.e. that the oil has been distributed evenly. In the beginning, the oil flows from oil-rich regions to places where there is not that much oil, but eventually a backflow will build up, and these two cancel out. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>1</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,5)' value='5' name='5'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='5_discourse_type' name='5_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,5)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='5_2nd_discourse_type' name='5_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div>","<div class='course-forum-post-container'> 							<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	 							<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'>	 						  <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid blue;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%' style='font-size:14' ><tbody> 							<tr><td><font color='red'>Instructor's Post</font></td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></td></tr> 							<tr><td> 							<div id = 'ipost' class='course-forum-post-text' dir='auto' style='font-size:14.5; line-height: 140%'>Thanks for the question.

Now, this is not just a matter of physics. Take the pebble and the heliport. If your throws are very short, it'll take a long time to sample the whole heliport (i.e. for the pebble to have visited all parts of it), and before you do, the estimate for pi will be very poor indeed. An analogy: Suppose you want to measure the area of a dish filled with water. What you have is oil and a way to measure the height of the oil film on top of the water. The idea is then to place a predetermined amount of oil on the surface of the water and once it has spread out measure its height, from which you can determine the area, right. Now the spreading out is a rather slow, diffusive process (incidentally, equations for the Markov Chain we used can be written in terms of the diffusion equation). If you were to measure the height of the oil film immediately, it would clearly depend on where exactly on the dish you do the measurement. Once you wait long enough, the entire dish is uniformly covered in oil, and it no onger matters where you do the measurement at. What is detailed balance in terms of this analogy? It means that there can be no net flow of oil from one place to the other, i.e. that the oil has been distributed evenly. In the beginning, the oil flows from oil-rich regions to places where there is not that much oil, but eventually a backflow will build up, and these two cancel out. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>1</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,5)' value='5' name='5'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='5_discourse_type' name='5_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,5)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='5_2nd_discourse_type' name='5_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div>","<div class='course-forum-post-container'> 							<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	 							<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'>	 						  <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid blue;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%' style='font-size:14' ><tbody> 							<tr><td><font color='red'>Instructor's Post</font></td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></td></tr> 							<tr><td> 							<div id = 'ipost' class='course-forum-post-text' dir='auto' style='font-size:14.5; line-height: 140%'>Thanks for the question.

Now, this is not just a matter of physics. Take the pebble and the heliport. If your throws are very short, it'll take a long time to sample the whole heliport (i.e. for the pebble to have visited all parts of it), and before you do, the estimate for pi will be very poor indeed. An analogy: Suppose you want to measure the area of a dish filled with water. What you have is oil and a way to measure the height of the oil film on top of the water. The idea is then to place a predetermined amount of oil on the surface of the water and once it has spread out measure its height, from which you can determine the area, right. Now the spreading out is a rather slow, diffusive process (incidentally, equations for the Markov Chain we used can be written in terms of the diffusion equation). If you were to measure the height of the oil film immediately, it would clearly depend on where exactly on the dish you do the measurement. Once you wait long enough, the entire dish is uniformly covered in oil, and it no onger matters where you do the measurement at. What is detailed balance in terms of this analogy? It means that there can be no net flow of oil from one place to the other, i.e. that the oil has been distributed evenly. In the beginning, the oil flows from oil-rich regions to places where there is not that much oil, but eventually a backflow will build up, and these two cancel out. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>1</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,5)' value='5' name='5'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='5_discourse_type' name='5_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,5)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='5_2nd_discourse_type' name='5_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div>","<div class='course-forum-post-container'> 							<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	 							<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'>	 						  <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid blue;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%' style='font-size:14' ><tbody> 							<tr><td><font color='red'>Instructor's Post</font></td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></td></tr> 							<tr><td> 							<div id = 'ipost' class='course-forum-post-text' dir='auto' style='font-size:14.5; line-height: 140%'>Thanks for the question.

Now, this is not just a matter of physics. Take the pebble and the heliport. If your throws are very short, it'll take a long time to sample the whole heliport (i.e. for the pebble to have visited all parts of it), and before you do, the estimate for pi will be very poor indeed. An analogy: Suppose you want to measure the area of a dish filled with water. What you have is oil and a way to measure the height of the oil film on top of the water. The idea is then to place a predetermined amount of oil on the surface of the water and once it has spread out measure its height, from which you can determine the area, right. Now the spreading out is a rather slow, diffusive process (incidentally, equations for the Markov Chain we used can be written in terms of the diffusion equation). If you were to measure the height of the oil film immediately, it would clearly depend on where exactly on the dish you do the measurement. Once you wait long enough, the entire dish is uniformly covered in oil, and it no onger matters where you do the measurement at. What is detailed balance in terms of this analogy? It means that there can be no net flow of oil from one place to the other, i.e. that the oil has been distributed evenly. In the beginning, the oil flows from oil-rich regions to places where there is not that much oil, but eventually a backflow will build up, and these two cancel out. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>1</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,5)' value='5' name='5'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='5_discourse_type' name='5_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,5)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='5_2nd_discourse_type' name='5_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div>","<div class='course-forum-post-container'> 							<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	 							<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'>	 						  <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid blue;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%' style='font-size:14' ><tbody> 							<tr><td><font color='red'>Instructor's Post</font></td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></td></tr> 							<tr><td> 							<div id = 'ipost' class='course-forum-post-text' dir='auto' style='font-size:14.5; line-height: 140%'>Thanks for the question.

Now, this is not just a matter of physics. Take the pebble and the heliport. If your throws are very short, it'll take a long time to sample the whole heliport (i.e. for the pebble to have visited all parts of it), and before you do, the estimate for pi will be very poor indeed. An analogy: Suppose you want to measure the area of a dish filled with water. What you have is oil and a way to measure the height of the oil film on top of the water. The idea is then to place a predetermined amount of oil on the surface of the water and once it has spread out measure its height, from which you can determine the area, right. Now the spreading out is a rather slow, diffusive process (incidentally, equations for the Markov Chain we used can be written in terms of the diffusion equation). If you were to measure the height of the oil film immediately, it would clearly depend on where exactly on the dish you do the measurement. Once you wait long enough, the entire dish is uniformly covered in oil, and it no onger matters where you do the measurement at. What is detailed balance in terms of this analogy? It means that there can be no net flow of oil from one place to the other, i.e. that the oil has been distributed evenly. In the beginning, the oil flows from oil-rich regions to places where there is not that much oil, but eventually a backflow will build up, and these two cancel out. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>1</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,5)' value='5' name='5'> </td>	<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='5_discourse_type' name='5_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,5)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='5_2nd_discourse_type' name='5_2nd_discourse_type'>	 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedbackreq'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option> 							<option value='completion'>Completion</option> 							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div>","<div class='course-forum-post-container'> 							<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	 							<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'>	 						  <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid blue;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%' style='font-size:14' ><tbody> 							<tr><td><font color='red'>Instructor's Post</font></td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></td></tr> 							<tr><td> 							<div id = 'ipost' class='course-forum-post-text' dir='auto' style='font-size:14.5; line-height: 140%'>Thanks for the question.

Also, isn't PI_A etc a probability of being at A etc, so how can it be over 1 and sum to over 1? And also how come the detailed balance condition was derived taking into account only three configurations a,b,c and assumed that everything is in relation to the 'a' top right corner square, when if it was in the centre 5 squares would need to be taken into account when seeing the next configuration. As it is, it seems to only take into account the first move, after having started on 'a'. Right now I'm in thoroughly confused. Hopefully that will change soon!

As you say the lecture illustrated the derivation of the detailed balance conditions for moves originating at a corner position.\xA0 It is clear, however, that the method could easily be extended to other starting positions, giving rise to 3 or 4 equalities of the form: $$\pi_a. p(a\rightarrow\beta) = \pi_\beta. p(\beta\rightarrow a)$$ corresponding to the 3 or 4 possible move directions. Note that all of the equalities must hold in order that the global balance condition is satisfied but we only need be concerned with one equality at a time since only one move direction is possible in any one time-step. The next stage in the lecture describes the Metropolis acceptance probability which is a mechanism to ensure that the detailed balance condition holds when $$\pi_a \neq \pi_\beta$$.\xA0 We need to choose $$p(a\rightarrow\beta)$$ and $$p(\beta\rightarrow a)$$ such that $$\pi_a / \pi_\beta = p(\beta\rightarrow a) / p(a\rightarrow\beta)$$ which is accomplished by modifying the transfer probability according to the ratio of weights as shown. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>2</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,2)' value='2' name='2'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='2_discourse_type' name='2_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,2)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='2_2nd_discourse_type' name='2_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #3 by User #2</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							In order to observe the validity of the Metropolis acceptance probability algorithm, we need to look at a given move from both directions after the system has settled into a steady state.

The next stage in the lecture describes the Metropolis acceptance probability which is a mechanism to ensure that the detailed balance condition holds when $$\pi_a \neq \pi_\beta$$.\xA0 We need to choose $$p(a\rightarrow\beta)$$ and $$p(\beta\rightarrow a)$$ such that $$\pi_a / \pi_\beta = p(\beta\rightarrow a) / p(a\rightarrow\beta)$$ which is accomplished by modifying the transfer probability according to the ratio of weights as shown. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>2</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,2)' value='2' name='2'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='2_discourse_type' name='2_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,2)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='2_2nd_discourse_type' name='2_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #3 by User #2</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							In order to observe the validity of the Metropolis acceptance probability algorithm, we need to look at a given move from both directions after the system has settled into a steady state.

As you say the lecture illustrated the derivation of the detailed balance conditions for moves originating at a corner position.\xA0 It is clear, however, that the method could easily be extended to other starting positions, giving rise to 3 or 4 equalities of the form: $$\pi_a. p(a\rightarrow\beta) = \pi_\beta. p(\beta\rightarrow a)$$ corresponding to the 3 or 4 possible move directions. Note that all of the equalities must hold in order that the global balance condition is satisfied but we only need be concerned with one equality at a time since only one move direction is possible in any one time-step.

As you say the lecture illustrated the derivation of the detailed balance conditions for moves originating at a corner position.\xA0 It is clear, however, that the method could easily be extended to other starting positions, giving rise to 3 or 4 equalities of the form: $$\pi_a. p(a\rightarrow\beta) = \pi_\beta. p(\beta\rightarrow a)$$ corresponding to the 3 or 4 possible move directions. Note that all of the equalities must hold in order that the global balance condition is satisfied but we only need be concerned with one equality at a time since only one move direction is possible in any one time-step.

As you say the lecture illustrated the derivation of the detailed balance conditions for moves originating at a corner position.\xA0 It is clear, however, that the method could easily be extended to other starting positions, giving rise to 3 or 4 equalities of the form: $$\pi_a. p(a\rightarrow\beta) = \pi_\beta. p(\beta\rightarrow a)$$ corresponding to the 3 or 4 possible move directions. Note that all of the equalities must hold in order that the global balance condition is satisfied but we only need be concerned with one equality at a time since only one move direction is possible in any one time-step.

As you say the lecture illustrated the derivation of the detailed balance conditions for moves originating at a corner position.\xA0 It is clear, however, that the method could easily be extended to other starting positions, giving rise to 3 or 4 equalities of the form: $$\pi_a. p(a\rightarrow\beta) = \pi_\beta. p(\beta\rightarrow a)$$ corresponding to the 3 or 4 possible move directions. Note that all of the equalities must hold in order that the global balance condition is satisfied but we only need be concerned with one equality at a time since only one move direction is possible in any one time-step. The next stage in the lecture describes the Metropolis acceptance probability which is a mechanism to ensure that the detailed balance condition holds when $$\pi_a \neq \pi_\beta$$.\xA0 We need to choose $$p(a\rightarrow\beta)$$ and $$p(\beta\rightarrow a)$$ such that $$\pi_a / \pi_\beta = p(\beta\rightarrow a) / p(a\rightarrow\beta)$$ which is accomplished by modifying the transfer probability according to the ratio of weights as shown. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>2</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,2)' value='2' name='2'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='2_discourse_type' name='2_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,2)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='2_2nd_discourse_type' name='2_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #3 by User #2</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							In order to observe the validity of the Metropolis acceptance probability algorithm, we need to look at a given move from both directions after the system has settled into a steady state.

The heliport experiment using the metropolis algorithm led to piles of stones around the edge of the square. In this case is the ratio of the number of stones in the circle to the total number of stones in the square still pi/4? And why start at one corner of the square when 3 out of 4 stones thrown from here would not even land in the square? The 3x3 pebble game was supposed to explain this but I was confused by the use of pi to denote probability.Is this the same pi as calculated in the first part of the lecture?
