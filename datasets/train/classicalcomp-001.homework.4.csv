In that way, you can have a smooth descending bass line going from Eb to D and to C.   Take note that in your deceptive cadence (V-VI in bar 9 to 10), the chord in the right hand has a B natural (the leading tone) in it's upper note.

In bar 8, you have used the V4/3 chord, which in this case, should have the same function as a passing 6-4 chord.

In that way, you can have a smooth descending bass line going from Eb to D and to C.   Take note that in your deceptive cadence (V-VI in bar 9 to 10), the chord in the right hand has a B natural (the leading tone) in it's upper note. This should resolve to the C.

I think I solved all of the parallel octaves (which I realize may be less worrisome for instrumental writing than for four-voice chorale, but even so...), but I am not sure if the solutions are proper to the style.  Specifically, in measures 7-8 (the half cadence), I needed to make use of a iv64 chord. Otherwise, I ran into parallel octaves with the oboe and bass line (Ab to G) or the right hand of the piano and the bass line (F to G), so I had the bass line stay on the C with a second-inversion iv chord, falling down the fourth to the G. Does this 'work'?  Second, I came up with the run of sixteenth notes (which I rather like, especially the interplay of the Bb and B) and a cadence with an initial suspension (mm 15-16) to solve similar issues in the deceptive cadence. Again, I think the voice leading is fine, but does it work stylistically?  (I also ran a few measures long, but that came in part from the 'tag' I added to the initial motif!)

Nice work! I am running out of time, but let me give my brief comments for now regarding your work.  In measures 7-8, your use of the 6-4 chord is not ideal. Although it helps with avoiding the parallel octave problem, it is neither functioning as a passing 6-4, pedal 6-4 or a cadential 6-4, so this is stylistically incorrect. Maybe you can consider using a iv6, and dropping the Ab to D. It's possible, but it makes the G in the melody pop out like a sore thumb. You can also try substituting the D - G to C - D with the iv6 and see how that works for you.  In measure 15-16, I'm afraid the melody sounds stylistically off. The play of Bb and B is the contributing factor, and I think you are better off substituting the Bb with the G (to make the Ab the neighbor tone), which is more stylistic. I think the suspension with the deceptive cadence is fine.   </div> <div class='stuck'><font color='red'>Instructor's post</font> : Hi Dominic. Nice work!

Nice work! I am running out of time, but let me give my brief comments for now regarding your work.  In measures 7-8, your use of the 6-4 chord is not ideal. Although it helps with avoiding the parallel octave problem, it is neither functioning as a passing 6-4, pedal 6-4 or a cadential 6-4, so this is stylistically incorrect. Maybe you can consider using a iv6, and dropping the Ab to D. It's possible, but it makes the G in the melody pop out like a sore thumb. You can also try substituting the D - G to C - D with the iv6 and see how that works for you.  In measure 15-16, I'm afraid the melody sounds stylistically off. The play of Bb and B is the contributing factor, and I think you are better off substituting the Bb with the G (to make the Ab the neighbor tone), which is more stylistic.

Nice work! I am running out of time, but let me give my brief comments for now regarding your work.  In measures 7-8, your use of the 6-4 chord is not ideal. Although it helps with avoiding the parallel octave problem, it is neither functioning as a passing 6-4, pedal 6-4 or a cadential 6-4, so this is stylistically incorrect. Maybe you can consider using a iv6, and dropping the Ab to D. It's possible, but it makes the G in the melody pop out like a sore thumb. You can also try substituting the D - G to C - D with the iv6 and see how that works for you.  In measure 15-16, I'm afraid the melody sounds stylistically off. The play of Bb and B is the contributing factor, and I think you are better off substituting the Bb with the G (to make the Ab the neighbor tone), which is more stylistic.

I think the suspension with the deceptive cadence is fine.   </div>  							</td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>0</span></font></div></td></tr></table></div></div></div>","","unclear"

It is a very nice composition, but my first thought about your work is that, I'm afraid it is not composed in parallel period form as required by the assignment. Although, I think it might work as parallel period form if you just repeat bars 1-9.   Here are my feedback to your questions.  1. Good question! We certainly don't want an augmented 2nd interval there, so what you've done to correct this is fine, because we still have the third in that 16th note (semiquaver) chord. Another option is that, you can voice that right hand 16th note (semiquaver) chord in bar 4 as D-F-Ab. Then in the next beat, you can have the full voicing of the V chord as B natural-D-G, while the next 16th note chord remain as D-G-B natural. 2. There is no problem with the progression itself, just that the voicing you are using for the right hand gives us the augmented 2nd interval between the Ab and the B natural. I don't see why changing the B natural to G and D to B natural is worst - in fact, this will solve the augmented 2nd problem, and the voice leading is quite smooth.  3. The Eb in the oboe in bar 11 an accented passing note. Accented passing notes should be treated with care. It should not be played simultaneously with its resolution note, which is the D in this case. That means, you should avoid sounding the oboe's Eb and the piano's D together as it induces a prominent dissonance. I suggest that you change the D in the piano to G instead.  Hope it helps! </div> <div class='stuck'><font color='red'>Instructor's post</font> : Hi there Akihiro.

We certainly don't want an augmented 2nd interval there, so what you've done to correct this is fine, because we still have the third in that 16th note (semiquaver) chord. Another option is that, you can voice that right hand 16th note (semiquaver) chord in bar 4 as D-F-Ab. Then in the next beat, you can have the full voicing of the V chord as B natural-D-G, while the next 16th note chord remain as D-G-B natural. 2. There is no problem with the progression itself, just that the voicing you are using for the right hand gives us the augmented 2nd interval between the Ab and the B natural. I don't see why changing the B natural to G and D to B natural is worst - in fact, this will solve the augmented 2nd problem, and the voice leading is quite smooth.  3. The Eb in the oboe in bar 11 an accented passing note. Accented passing notes should be treated with care. It should not be played simultaneously with its resolution note, which is the D in this case. That means, you should avoid sounding the oboe's Eb and the piano's D together as it induces a prominent dissonance. I suggest that you change the D in the piano to G instead.  Hope it helps! </div> <div class='stuck'><font color='red'>Instructor's post</font> : Hi there Akihiro.

It is a very nice composition, but my first thought about your work is that, I'm afraid it is not composed in parallel period form as required by the assignment. Although, I think it might work as parallel period form if you just repeat bars 1-9.   Here are my feedback to your questions.  1. Good question! We certainly don't want an augmented 2nd interval there, so what you've done to correct this is fine, because we still have the third in that 16th note (semiquaver) chord. Another option is that, you can voice that right hand 16th note (semiquaver) chord in bar 4 as D-F-Ab. Then in the next beat, you can have the full voicing of the V chord as B natural-D-G, while the next 16th note chord remain as D-G-B natural. 2. There is no problem with the progression itself, just that the voicing you are using for the right hand gives us the augmented 2nd interval between the Ab and the B natural. I don't see why changing the B natural to G and D to B natural is worst - in fact, this will solve the augmented 2nd problem, and the voice leading is quite smooth.  3. The Eb in the oboe in bar 11 an accented passing note. Accented passing notes should be treated with care. It should not be played simultaneously with its resolution note, which is the D in this case. That means, you should avoid sounding the oboe's Eb and the piano's D together as it induces a prominent dissonance. I suggest that you change the D in the piano to G instead.  Hope it helps! </div> <div class='stuck'><font color='red'>Instructor's post</font> : Hi there Akihiro.

Maybe the consecutive leap up and down the third and the lower neighbor tone makes for an awkward pattern which just doesn't sound stylistic.

However, you have a problem in the melody with this chord progression - the Bb will not go well with the viio6 which has a B natural.   Patrick is right with the progression at bars 10-11. To make it a cadence, you need to create a punctuation in the music at bar 11. In your melody in bar 11, the melody continues on with eight notes.

Maybe the consecutive leap up and down the third and the lower neighbor tone makes for an awkward pattern which just doesn't sound stylistic.

However, you have a problem in the melody with this chord progression - the Bb will not go well with the viio6 which has a B natural.   Patrick is right with the progression at bars 10-11. To make it a cadence, you need to create a punctuation in the music at bar 11. In your melody in bar 11, the melody continues on with eight notes.

For example, in bar 6 an F natural would sound better to my ear than the F sharp. In bar 8, you have a B flat in the oboe and a B natural in the piano chord, which I don't think is stylistically acceptable. Also in bar 8, I don't understand the chord on the second beat - I think a G in the left hand would be better that the D, which doesn't belong to the chord if it's meant to be C minor (i). Those are the main things that jump out at me.  Is your DC at bars 10-11? It doesn't really sound like a cadence, because the music doesn't stop at all. </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>0</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,1)' value='1' name='1'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='1_discourse_type' name='1_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,1)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='1_2nd_discourse_type' name='1_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div>","<div class='course-forum-post-container'> 							<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	 							<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'>	 						  <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid blue;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%' style='font-size:14' ><tbody> 							<tr><td><font color='red'>Instructor's Post</font></td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></td></tr> 							<tr><td> 							<div id = 'ipost' class='course-forum-post-text' dir='auto' style='font-size:14.5; line-height: 140%'>Hi Stephen   There's something in your melody in bar 2 that doesn't sound stylistically right to me. Maybe the consecutive leap up and down the third and the lower neighbor tone makes for an awkward pattern which just doesn't sound stylistic.   In bar 6, the F# and the Eb makes an interval of an augmented 2nd, which absolutely sound dissonant and unstylistic and should be avoided altogether. Patrick's solution of changing it to F natural is better.   With the second beat chord in bar 8, I'm guessing you meant it to be the viio6 chord. It will make more sense to change that second beat chord into B natural - F. However, you have a problem in the melody with this chord progression - the Bb will not go well with the viio6 which has a B natural.   Patrick is right with the progression at bars 10-11. To make it a cadence, you need to create a punctuation in the music at bar 11. In your melody in bar 11, the melody continues on with eight notes. What you can actually do there to make it a clear deceptive cadence is by stopping at the C and sustaining the note and the chord.  Hope it helps! </div> <div class='stuck'><font color='red'>Instructor's post</font> : Hi Stephen   There's something in your melody in bar 2 that doesn't sound stylistically right to me.

Nice effort. Here are my comments.  Firstly, you have indicated that the melody is written for the Trumpet in C. I think the high notes in your melody are pushing the limits of the instrument, isn't it? (eg. F in bar 5). Maybe it is possible to be played by a very good player, otherwise, we must be cautious about the range and limitations of the instrument that we are writing for.  I agree with Bill about the leading tone at the end of Bar 2. The suggestion of dropping the melody down a third is a good one - that way you can still keep the sequence from the first bar whilst avoiding the leading tone problem.   I see a problem with bar 4. You are right about the augmented 2nd. This is between the Ab and the B natural, so you should consider changing that. Also, the leap from D at the end of bar 3 to Eb at the beginning of bar 4 is not very ideal. In bar 3, we come into some sort of a climax by leaping an octave between the two Eb, but then having another large leap again from bar 3 to bar 4 between the D and Eb makes the melody abruptly jump out of the climax and creates instability. It would be better if you can continue the melody in bar 4 by using steps or smaller leaps, say, start with a C stepwise from the previous D.   It's good that you have done a diatonic substitution with bar 4 and bar 9 (iio6-5 and iv). About your deceptive cadence, I think it is better if you can keep it to root position, instead of inverting to the first inversion - it makes the deceptive cadence sound more prominent this way.     Hope it helps! </div> <div class='stuck'><font color='red'>Instructor's post</font> : Hi Nick. Nice effort. Here are my comments.

Nice effort. Here are my comments.  Firstly, you have indicated that the melody is written for the Trumpet in C. I think the high notes in your melody are pushing the limits of the instrument, isn't it? (eg. F in bar 5). Maybe it is possible to be played by a very good player, otherwise, we must be cautious about the range and limitations of the instrument that we are writing for.  I agree with Bill about the leading tone at the end of Bar 2. The suggestion of dropping the melody down a third is a good one - that way you can still keep the sequence from the first bar whilst avoiding the leading tone problem.   I see a problem with bar 4. You are right about the augmented 2nd. This is between the Ab and the B natural, so you should consider changing that. Also, the leap from D at the end of bar 3 to Eb at the beginning of bar 4 is not very ideal. In bar 3, we come into some sort of a climax by leaping an octave between the two Eb, but then having another large leap again from bar 3 to bar 4 between the D and Eb makes the melody abruptly jump out of the climax and creates instability. It would be better if you can continue the melody in bar 4 by using steps or smaller leaps, say, start with a C stepwise from the previous D.   It's good that you have done a diatonic substitution with bar 4 and bar 9 (iio6-5 and iv). About your deceptive cadence, I think it is better if you can keep it to root position, instead of inverting to the first inversion - it makes the deceptive cadence sound more prominent this way.     Hope it helps! </div> <div class='stuck'><font color='red'>Instructor's post</font> : Hi Nick. Nice effort. Here are my comments.

Also, the leap from D at the end of bar 3 to Eb at the beginning of bar 4 is not very ideal. In bar 3, we come into some sort of a climax by leaping an octave between the two Eb, but then having another large leap again from bar 3 to bar 4 between the D and Eb makes the melody abruptly jump out of the climax and creates instability. It would be better if you can continue the melody in bar 4 by using steps or smaller leaps, say, start with a C stepwise from the previous D.   It's good that you have done a diatonic substitution with bar 4 and bar 9 (iio6-5 and iv). About your deceptive cadence, I think it is better if you can keep it to root position, instead of inverting to the first inversion - it makes the deceptive cadence sound more prominent this way.

Nice effort. Here are my comments.  Firstly, you have indicated that the melody is written for the Trumpet in C. I think the high notes in your melody are pushing the limits of the instrument, isn't it? (eg. F in bar 5). Maybe it is possible to be played by a very good player, otherwise, we must be cautious about the range and limitations of the instrument that we are writing for.  I agree with Bill about the leading tone at the end of Bar 2. The suggestion of dropping the melody down a third is a good one - that way you can still keep the sequence from the first bar whilst avoiding the leading tone problem.   I see a problem with bar 4.

The suggestion of dropping the melody down a third is a good one - that way you can still keep the sequence from the first bar whilst avoiding the leading tone problem.   I see a problem with bar 4. You are right about the augmented 2nd. This is between the Ab and the B natural, so you should consider changing that. Also, the leap from D at the end of bar 3 to Eb at the beginning of bar 4 is not very ideal. In bar 3, we come into some sort of a climax by leaping an octave between the two Eb, but then having another large leap again from bar 3 to bar 4 between the D and Eb makes the melody abruptly jump out of the climax and creates instability. It would be better if you can continue the melody in bar 4 by using steps or smaller leaps, say, start with a C stepwise from the previous D.   It's good that you have done a diatonic substitution with bar 4 and bar 9 (iio6-5 and iv). About your deceptive cadence, I think it is better if you can keep it to root position, instead of inverting to the first inversion - it makes the deceptive cadence sound more prominent this way.     Hope it helps! </div> <div class='stuck'><font color='red'>Instructor's post</font> : Hi Nick. Nice effort. Here are my comments.  Firstly, you have indicated that the melody is written for the Trumpet in C. I think the high notes in your melody are pushing the limits of the instrument, isn't it? (eg. F in bar 5).
