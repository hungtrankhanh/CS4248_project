Has anyone else had the same problem, or know which step I am doing wrong? </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>1</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,7)' value='7' name='7'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_discourse_type' name='7_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,7)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_2nd_discourse_type' name='7_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #8 by User #2</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Your question is a little short on details--so some general advice.

Has anyone else had the same problem, or know which step I am doing wrong? </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>1</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,7)' value='7' name='7'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_discourse_type' name='7_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,7)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_2nd_discourse_type' name='7_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #8 by User #2</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Your question is a little short on details--so some general advice.

Has anyone else had the same problem, or know which step I am doing wrong? </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>1</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,7)' value='7' name='7'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_discourse_type' name='7_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,7)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_2nd_discourse_type' name='7_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #8 by User #2</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Your question is a little short on details--so some general advice.

Has anyone else had the same problem, or know which step I am doing wrong? </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>1</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,7)' value='7' name='7'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_discourse_type' name='7_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,7)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_2nd_discourse_type' name='7_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #8 by User #2</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Your question is a little short on details--so some general advice.

Has anyone else had the same problem, or know which step I am doing wrong? </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>1</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,7)' value='7' name='7'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_discourse_type' name='7_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,7)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_2nd_discourse_type' name='7_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #8 by User #2</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Your question is a little short on details--so some general advice.

Has anyone else had the same problem, or know which step I am doing wrong? </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>1</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,7)' value='7' name='7'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_discourse_type' name='7_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,7)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_2nd_discourse_type' name='7_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #8 by User #2</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Your question is a little short on details--so some general advice.

Has anyone else had the same problem, or know which step I am doing wrong? </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>1</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,7)' value='7' name='7'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_discourse_type' name='7_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,7)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_2nd_discourse_type' name='7_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #8 by User #2</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Your question is a little short on details--so some general advice.

Has anyone else had the same problem, or know which step I am doing wrong? </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class='course-forum-post-vote-controls' data-tooltip-position='down' data-tooltip='Please use votes to bring attention to thoughtful, helpful posts.' aria-expanded='false' aria-haspopup='true'> 			<div class='course-forum-post-vote-button course-forum-post-vote-up course-forum-vote-inactive' role='button' data-direction-value='1' aria-label='Vote this post up.' tabindex='0'><font size='2'>Upvotes:</div> 			<span class='course-forum-post-vote-count course-forum-votes-positive'>1</span></font></div></td></tr><tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'><h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>Yes, the instructor's post <b>clearly</b> refers to the content in this student post &nbsp;&nbsp;<input type='checkbox' onclick='enableCombo(this,7)' value='7' name='7'></td> 							<td><a href='#ipost'>Go to Instructor's post</a></td></tr> 							<tr><td colspan = '2'>&nbsp;</td></tr> 							<!--<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.1) Categorise the reply type &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_discourse_type' name='7_discourse_type' onChange='enableCombo2(this,7)'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option>							 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select> 							</select> 							</td></tr> 							<tr><td style='text-align:left'>2.2) Assign a second reply type (optional) &nbsp; 							<select disabled='' id='7_2nd_discourse_type' name='7_2nd_discourse_type'> 							<option value disabled selected> -- select an option -- </option> 							<option value='paraphrase'>Paraphrase</option>  							<option value='feedback'>Feedback Request</option>  							<option value='clarification'>Clarification</option> 							<option value='refinement'>Refinement</option> 							<option value='juxtaposition'>Juxtaposition</option> 							<option value='justify'>Justification Request</option>  							<option value='critique'>Reasoning Critique</option>  							<option value='summary'>Integration / Summarisation</option>  							<option value='extension'>Extension</option>  							<option value='completion'>Completion</option>  							<option value='appreciation'>Appreciation</option> 							<option value='answer'>Generic answer</option>  							<option value='agreement'>Agreement</option>  							<option value='disagreement'>Disagreement</option> 							<option value='other'>Other</option></select>							 							</select> 							</td></tr>--> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label> 							</td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class='course-forum-post-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-top-container'>	<div class='course-forum-comments-container'> 								<div class='course-forum-post-view-container'> <table width='100%' style='border: 2px solid grey;' cellpadding=10> 							<tr><td><label><div class='course-forum-post-header'> 							<h5 class='course-forum-post-byline'> 							<table width='100%'  style='font-size:14'><tbody> 							<tr><td>POST #8 by User #2</td></tr> 							</tbody></table></h5></div></label></td></tr> 							<tr><td><div dir='auto' class='course-forum-post-text' style='font-size:14; line-height: 140%'> 							Your question is a little short on details--so some general advice.
